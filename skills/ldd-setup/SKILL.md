description: Run /ldd:setup to bootstrap a target repository for Ledger-Driven Development. Use when the user says /ldd:setup, asks to set up LDD in a repo, or needs .ldd/config.yml, docs/tickets, local ledger support, and LDD templates created.

# /ldd:setup

Bootstrap the current target repository for the LDD MVP workflow.

## Preflight

- Confirm this is a target project, not the LDD skill source repo. If `skills/ldd-setup/SKILL.md` or another LDD skill source exists in the repo, stop and ask whether the user intends to dogfood LDD here.
- Detect whether `.ldd/config.yml` already exists.
  - If it exists, treat this as a setup rerun. Read and summarize the current settings before changing files:
    - ledger mode, draft directory, archive directory, local ID prefix
    - tracker provider, repo/project/default branch
    - artifact root
    - branch and PR naming patterns
    - plan renderer setting
    - ADR directory and update policy
  - Ask the human to confirm whether to keep these settings or change them. Do not silently change existing settings.
  - If the existing config conflicts with the requested setup mode and the human has not explicitly approved the change, stop.
- If `.ldd/config.yml` does not exist, ask whether to use local-only mode or GitHub projection mode.
  - Local-only is the recommended default.
  - GitHub is the first MVP external tracker projection path. If selected, ask for the GitHub repo and default branch before writing config.
  - Linear and Jira are follow-on compatibility targets and should be recorded as future intent, not configured as working providers.
- External tracker setup only configures projection intent. Future external mutations still require explicit human confirmation and drift checks.

## Create

- `docs/tickets/`
- `docs/tickets/_drafts/`
- `docs/tickets/_archive/`
- `.ldd/config.yml`
- `.ldd/templates/ledger.yml`
- `.ldd/templates/prd.md`
- `.ldd/templates/sdd.md`
- `.ldd/templates/plan.md`
- `.ldd/templates/plan.html`
- `.ldd/templates/verification.md`
- `.ldd/templates/issue-body-prd.md`
- `.ldd/templates/issue-body-sdd.md`
- `.ldd/templates/issue-body-child.md`
- `.ldd/templates/pr-body-prd.md`
- `.ldd/templates/pr-body-sdd-plan.md`
- `.ldd/templates/pr-body-implementation.md`

Use bundled templates from `assets/templates/`.

Copy templates exactly unless the user explicitly asks to customize them. The templates include artifact quality guidance and are part of the LDD workflow contract, not just blank markdown scaffolds.

## Rules

- Repo-local ledger is canonical. External trackers are optional sync/review surfaces.
- External mutations require human confirmation.
- GitHub-first tracker readiness means GitHub issues for PRD, SDD, and child work visibility and GitHub PRs for implementation review, all as managed projections of the repo-local ledger.
- Linear and Jira remain optional follow-on collaboration surfaces until the GitHub projection model is proven.
- Every Product Requirement starts in `docs/tickets/_drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug/` with a `ledger.yml`.
- Promotion moves the draft directory to a stable ticket ID directory. Local mode uses the configured local prefix. GitHub mode creates or binds the Product Requirement issue during PRD approval and uses the GitHub issue number as the ticket ID.
- Do not create `docs/adr/` during setup. The ADR directory is created or confirmed only when the first ADR is needed.
- Do not push, create external tickets, open PRs, comment, request reviewers, or otherwise mutate an external tracker.
- Show a summary and diff. Commit locally only after explicit human approval.

## Stop Conditions

- `.ldd/config.yml` exists with conflicting settings
