# SDD: {title}

## Boundary Source

- Work Item type: `{work_item_type}`
- Approved boundary source: `{boundary_source}`
- Product Requirement issue: `{prd_issue}`
- Triage outcome projection: `{triage_projection_url}`

## Open Design Questions

## Next Action

Review the design boundary and verification strategy. If the design is sound, continue with `/gadd:plan {work_item_id}`. If the design is unclear, comment with the missing engineering decision before planning starts.

## Reviewer Focus

- Repository ownership and boundary source are clear.
- The SDD is specific enough for implementation planning.
- A non-GADD engineer or agent can find the canonical SDD, plan, and ledger from this issue.

## GADD Status

- Phase: SDD approved / plan ready
- Canonical state: repo-local ledger
- External tracker role: GitHub issue projection for SDD visibility
- Relationship: for `product_requirement`, child of the Product Requirement issue; for `engineering_change`, projection of the approved triage outcome. Implementation child Work Items created by decomposition are children of this SDD issue when supported.

## GADD Traceability

- Work Item: `{work_item_id}`
- Work Item type: `{work_item_type}`
- Local ledger: `gadd/work-items/{work_item_id}/ledger.yml`
- Expected labels: `gadd`, `type:engineering-change`, `phase:planning`

## GADD Links

- Ledger: `{ledger_path}`
- PRD: `{prd_path}`
- Triage outcome: `{triage_projection_url}`
- SDD: `{sdd_path}`
- Plan: `{plan_path}`
