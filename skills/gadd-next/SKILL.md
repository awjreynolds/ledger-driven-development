description: Run /gadd:next for a GADD ticket. Use when the user says /gadd:next, asks for the next GADD command, or wants to diagnose workflow state from repo-local ledgers.

# /gadd:next

Read repo-local ledger state and report the next explicit GADD command and next human action.

## Input

`/gadd:next [ticket-id]`

## Reads

- active `docs/tickets/**/ledger.yml`
- `execution_context` when present
- draft directories under `docs/tickets/_drafts/`
- parent ticket artifacts
- child vertical-slice ticket state
- child implementation, verification, and closure state
- external tracker sync state and body drift when configured
- implementation PR state when a ledger records an implementation PR URL or number

## Input Quality Gate

Required input standard before reporting workflow navigation:

- readable active ledger state, or enough artifact state to derive equivalent phase state
- no ambiguous multiple active drafts unless the user selected one
- child ledger paths are readable when parent state depends on children
- external tracker drift metadata is either clean or reported as a blocker
- implementation PR state is checked from the external tracker when needed to distinguish review/merge waiting from verification-ready work

If inputs fail this standard, do not mutate anything and report the ambiguity or missing state. The earliest GADD command that can repair missing setup is `/gadd:setup`; missing decomposition routes to `/gadd:decompose`; ambiguous or drifted state requires human reconciliation before another command runs.

## Rules

- Read-only. It never mutates GitHub or local files.
- Repo-local ledger is canonical. External trackers are optional sync/review surfaces.
- External mutations require human confirmation, and this command does not perform mutations.
- Treat PR review, approval, merge, close, and branch deletion as external actions. Do not infer them from the conversation, branch names, local commits, or the user's statement. If a ledger records an implementation PR, read the external PR state before deciding the next command.
- If the external PR is merged but the repo-local ledger has not recorded the merge commit and merge time, route to `/gadd:verify <child-ticket-id>` so verification can record observed merge evidence and finish the child-ticket closure-readiness check.
- Report external tracker drift only when the external PR state conflicts with recorded ledger state, cannot be read, or is closed without merge.
- If the external PR is still open, report that review/merge remains the next human action and do not route to `/gadd:verify`.
- Ignore `docs/tickets/_archive/` unless the user explicitly asks to inspect archived tickets.
- Use `.gadd/config.yml` when present.
- Prefer `execution_context` when present, but verify it against ledger artifact state before reporting the next command.
- Report both `execution_context.next_command` and `execution_context.next_human_action` when present. If `next_human_action` is missing, derive it from the active gate.
- If `execution_context` is absent, derive equivalent state from ticket status, artifact statuses, child ledgers, `closure.status`, sync metadata, and archived-child location.
- Preserve approved PRD, SDD, and plan boundaries. If the next step would change those boundaries, report the earliest affected `/gadd:scope`, `/gadd:design`, or `/gadd:plan` gate instead of routing implementation or verification.
- Prioritize parent roll-up closure when all children are verified and closeable.
- Prioritize verified but unclosed child work before verification and implementation.
- Prioritize child work with completed implementation evidence and unverified closure before starting additional child implementation.
- Treat `/gadd:archive` as optional cleanup only. Do not route to archive as required workflow work after closure.
- When continuation is safe and commandable, name the exact command the user can run next.
- When continuation requires human review, approval, drift reconciliation, external mutation confirmation, or a blocked choice, name the human decision instead of offering unsafe automation.
- PRD, SDD, and plan approval gates must route to `/gadd:approve <ticket-id>`.

## Report Contract

Always report:

- ticket ID and current phase/gate
- `next_command`, if available or derivable
- `next_human_action`, if available or derivable
- a copyable command block containing only the next command when continuation is commandable
- reason
- blocking decision, if blocked

Use this shape:

```text
Next command: /gadd:plan GADD-0003
Next human action: none
Reason: SDD is approved and ready for implementation planning.
Copy:
```

```text
/gadd:plan GADD-0003
```

For approval gates:

```text
Next command: /gadd:approve GADD-0003
Next human action: /gadd:approve GADD-0003
Reason: The PRD, SDD, or plan is waiting for explicit approval.
Copy:
```

```text
/gadd:approve GADD-0003
```

For blocked gates:

```text
Next command: blocked
Next human action: reconcile external tracker drift
Reason: The external body changed since the last recorded sync hash.
Copy: not available
```

## Decision Tree

```text
If no ledger exists:
  next: /gadd:setup
Else if draft PRD exists:
  inspect PRD completeness and recommend /gadd:scope, /gadd:elaborate, /gadd:refine, or /gadd:approve <ticket-id> for PRD approval
Else if parent ticket is closed, externally closed, archived, or done:
  done
  optional_cleanup_command: /gadd:archive <parent-ticket-id> only when the ticket is closed in the active tree and the human wants local cleanup
Else if parent has children and every child is verified and closeable or already closed:
  next: /gadd:close <parent-ticket-id>
Else if any active child is verified but not closed or archived:
  next: /gadd:close <child-ticket-id>
Else if implementation PR exists and external PR state is open:
  next: blocked
  next_human_action: review and merge implementation PR
Else if any active child has completed implementation evidence and unverified closure:
  next: /gadd:verify <child-ticket-id>
Else if ready child vertical slices exist:
  next: /gadd:implement <child-ticket-id>
Else if plan is approved and no child tickets exist:
  next: /gadd:decompose
Else if plan exists but is not approved:
  next: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
  next_human_action: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
Else if SDD is approved:
  next: /gadd:plan
Else if SDD exists but is not approved:
  next: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
  next_human_action: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
Else if PRD is approved:
  next: /gadd:design
Else if refined PRD is waiting for approval:
  next: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
  next_human_action: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
Else:
  next: /gadd:scope
```

## Approval Gate Detection

Treat a PRD as waiting for approval when either:

- `execution_context.phase` is `refine` and `execution_context.current_gate: prd_approval`
- `execution_context.current_gate: prd_approval` and `execution_context.next_command` is `/gadd:approve <ticket-id>`

Do not treat every draft PRD as approval-ready. Drafts in `scope` or `elaborate` must route to `/gadd:elaborate` or `/gadd:refine`, even when `approved_artifacts.prd` is empty.

Report:

```text
next_command: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
next_human_action: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
```

Treat an SDD as waiting for approval when either:

- `execution_context.current_gate: design_review`
- `artifacts.sdd.status: draft` and `artifacts.prd.status: approved`

Report:

```text
next_command: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
next_human_action: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
```

Treat a plan as waiting for approval when either:

- `execution_context.current_gate: plan_review`
- `artifacts.plan.status: draft` and `artifacts.sdd.status: approved`

Report:

```text
next_command: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
next_human_action: /gadd:approve <ticket-id>
```

If more than one PRD, SDD, or plan approval gate appears active, report the ambiguity and route to human reconciliation. Do not choose one silently.

## Verification Gate Detection

Treat an active child as needing verification when either of these is true:

- `execution_context.current_gate: verification` or `execution_context.next_command` is `/gadd:verify <child-ticket-id>`.
- Derived state shows implementation completed while closure is not verified.

Derived state means implementation evidence exists, for example `artifacts.implementation.status: completed`, `artifacts.implementation.evidence`, a recorded implementation completion event, or equivalent local changed-file/check evidence in the child ledger; and closure is unverified, for example missing `closure`, `closure.status: open`, `closure.status: verification_required`, missing `artifacts.verification`, or `artifacts.verification.status: missing | pending | failed`.

Do not route archived, closed, or externally closed children, or children with `closure.status: verified | closed | archived | externally_closed`, to `/gadd:verify`.

## Closure Gate Detection

Treat an active child as ready to close when either of these is true:

- `execution_context.current_gate: closure` or `execution_context.next_command` is `/gadd:close <child-ticket-id>`.
- Derived state shows verification passed while closure has not been applied.

Derived state means `artifacts.verification.status: passed`, `closure.status: verified`, and the child directory is still in the active ticket tree rather than `_archive/`.

Do not route children with `closure.status: closed | archived | externally_closed` to `/gadd:close`.

Treat a parent as ready for roll-up closure when it has at least one child and every child is either:

- already closed with `closure.status: closed | archived | externally_closed`
- closeable with `artifacts.verification.status: passed`, `closure.status: verified`, and a readable `verification.md`

If any child is implemented but unverified, route to `/gadd:verify <child-ticket-id>`. If any child is ready but not implemented, route to `/gadd:implement <child-ticket-id>`.

## Archive Cleanup Detection

Treat a ticket as optionally ready to archive when it has `closure.status: closed | externally_closed`, lives in the active ticket tree, and the configured `archive_directory` exists or can be created safely. Report this as optional cleanup, not as `next_command`, unless the user explicitly asks for `/gadd:archive`.

## Implementation PR State Detection

When a parent or child ledger records implementation PR evidence, for example `artifacts.implementation.pr`, `artifacts.implementation.evidence.implementation_pr`, or equivalent PR URL/number:

- Read the external PR state from the configured tracker before reporting `/gadd:verify` or `/gadd:close`.
- For GitHub, inspect the PR number or URL and check at least `state`, `mergedAt`, and merge commit.
- If the PR is open, report `next_command: blocked` and `next_human_action: review and merge implementation PR`.
- If the PR is merged, route to `/gadd:verify <child-ticket-id>`. Verification owns recording observed merge evidence and deciding whether the child can pass.
- If the PR is closed without merge, report `next_command: blocked` and route back to `/gadd:implement <child-ticket-id>` or human reconciliation depending on the child state.

Never treat a conversational claim such as "merged" as merge evidence. The claim may explain why the command should check the external tracker, but it is not workflow state.

## Stop Conditions

- requested ticket ID not found
- ledger cannot be parsed
- multiple active drafts and no ticket ID was supplied
- external tracker drift is detected
- external ticket body changed since the last recorded sync hash or timestamp
- implementation PR state cannot be checked when it is required to choose the next gate
