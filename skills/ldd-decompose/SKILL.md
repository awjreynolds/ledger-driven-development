description: Run /ldd:decompose after an approved LDD plan. Use when the user says /ldd:decompose or needs plan slices turned into child vertical-slice tickets for implementation.

# /ldd:decompose

Turn an approved `plan.md` into child vertical-slice tickets.

## Reads

- parent `ledger.yml`
- approved PRD
- approved SDD
- approved `plan.md`

## Produces

- child ticket entries in the parent ledger
- child ticket ledgers under the parent ticket directory
- external child tickets only when a tracker is configured and the human approves

## Preview Before Creation

Before creating or updating any child ticket, present the proposed ticket set and stop for human approval. This approval is not handled by `/ldd:approve`; it is a decomposition review decision.

Use this review shape:

```text
Proposed child tickets:

1. <title>
   Type: Autonomous | Human-review
   Blocked by: None | <ticket title/id>
   User stories covered: <PRD story numbers>
   Summary: <one or two sentences>

Ask:
- Does the granularity feel right?
- Are dependency relationships correct?
- Are Autonomous/Human-review classifications correct?
- Should any tickets be merged or split?
```

Only after approval may the command create child ledgers or external child tickets. When stopping before approval, set `execution_context.next_human_action` to the decomposition review decision.

## Rules

- Repo-local ledger is canonical. External trackers are optional sync/review surfaces.
- External mutations require human confirmation.
- Decompose only from an approved plan. Do not invent scope or architecture.
- Child tickets are vertical slices derived from plan slices, not layer tasks.
- Each child ticket must be independently grabbable: an implementation agent can read the ticket, follow links as needed, and understand what end-to-end behavior to build, what acceptance criteria must pass, what it is blocked by, and which user stories or PRD criteria it covers.
- Each child ticket must reference the parent Product Requirement and approved plan slice.
- In GitHub tracker mode, each child ticket must also reference the approved SDD issue, making implementation child tickets children of the SDD issue and grandchildren of the PRD issue.
- External child ticket bodies use LDD's standalone child issue shape: Parent, What to build, Acceptance criteria, Blocked by, User stories covered, plus minimal LDD Traceability.
- In GitHub tracker mode, child tickets may be projected as GitHub issues after explicit human confirmation. Each projected child issue must record its PRD issue reference, SDD issue reference, plan slice, and local ledger path. The child ledger remains canonical.
- Linear and Jira child-ticket projections are follow-on optional collaboration surfaces.
- Before updating an existing external child ticket, re-read it. If its body changed since the last recorded sync hash or timestamp, stop and ask the human to reconcile the external contribution.
- Keep the MVP lightweight: do not create a separate decomposition artifact unless the user explicitly asks.

## Stop Conditions

- parent ledger missing
- plan is missing or not approved
- plan slices are too vague to turn into independently grabbable vertical slices
- external tracker is configured but cannot be reached
- human rejects the proposed child ticket set
