description: Run /ldd:implement for an LDD child vertical-slice ticket. Use when the user says /ldd:implement or wants to execute an approved child ticket with code and tests.

# /ldd:implement

Execute one ready child vertical-slice ticket.

## Reads

- child ticket ledger
- parent Product Requirement ledger
- approved PRD
- approved SDD
- approved `plan.md`

## Rules

- Repo-local ledger is canonical. External trackers are optional sync/review surfaces.
- External mutations require human confirmation.
- Follow the approved child ticket and parent plan, and preserve approved PRD, SDD, and plan boundaries. Do not silently update `plan.md` from implementation.
- Do not auto-decompose. If no ready child tickets exist, report that there are no tickets to implement. If the plan is approved but no child tickets exist, report that `/ldd:decompose` is required.
- If the plan is wrong, stop and return to the earliest affected `/ldd:design` or `/ldd:plan` step.
- The implementation PR contains product code and tests only. Do not write `progress.md`.
- Run configured checks before PR.
- Use the implementation PR body template to summarize plan adherence, tests/checks, and any approved deviations.
- Record implementation completion evidence in the child ledger, including changed-file summary, check evidence, and any implementation PR or local diff reference available.
- Mark the child as implemented but not closed by setting `artifacts.implementation.status: completed`, `ticket.status: verification_required`, `closure.status: verification_required`, and `execution_context.next_command: /ldd:verify <child-ticket-id>` when those fields are available.
- If the ledger lacks verification or closure fields, record equivalent implementation completion evidence and state that `/ldd:verify <child-ticket-id>` is the next gate so `/ldd:next` can derive the same state.
- Do not archive child tickets.
- Do not close external child work items.
- Do not mark child work done, archived, externally closed, or verified from this command; `/ldd:verify` decides closure readiness after implementation completion.
- Implementation PR reviewer prompt: "Does this implementation follow the approved plan?"

## Built-in TDD Loop

LDD is standalone. Run this loop directly from this skill; do not delegate it to another installed skill, command, or methodology package.

For each behavior in the child ticket:

1. Identify the next acceptance criterion or plan verification point.
2. Write the smallest focused test that proves the behavior is missing.
3. Run the focused test and confirm it fails for the expected reason.
4. Write the smallest implementation that makes the test pass.
5. Run the focused test and confirm it passes.
6. Refactor only after the focused test is green.
7. Rerun the relevant broader test suite before moving to the next behavior.

If no test harness exists, create the smallest credible harness first. If a behavior cannot be tested automatically, state the reason and add the narrowest credible manual verification.

## Stop Conditions

- child ticket missing
- no ready child tickets exist
- plan is approved but `/ldd:decompose` has not created child tickets
- plan is wrong
- tests/checks fail
- implementation requires a product-scope change
