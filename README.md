# Ledger-Driven Development Skills

Agent-agnostic skills for the Ledger-Driven Development MVP.

LDD uses a repo-local ledger as canonical workflow state. External trackers such as GitHub, Linear, or Jira are optional sync and review surfaces. LDD separates product scope, engineering design, implementation planning, decomposition, and implementation so AI-assisted work has explicit, reviewable handoffs.

## Package Model

The canonical package manifest is `agent-skills.json`.

The canonical skill source is the Agent Skills layout:

```text
skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
skills/<skill-name>/assets/
skills/<skill-name>/agents/openai.yaml
```

`agent-skills.json` lists every installable skill path and adapter manifest. Adapter-specific files point back to the matching skill. They are not a second source of truth.

Adapter manifests make the same skills installable in specific agents:

| Agent | Adapter files |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | `skills/ldd-*`, `agents/openai.yaml`, `agent-skills.json` |
| Claude Code | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `skills/ldd-*` |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini-extension.json`, `GEMINI.md`, `commands/ldd/*.toml`, `skills/ldd-*` |

There is no `ldd-core` skill to install. Shared LDD rules are intentionally embedded in each command-shaped skill so every agent sees the same command contract.

The current workflow design is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-12-local-ledger-mvp-design.md`. Older GitHub-ledger specs remain as historical context only.

## Commands

```text
/ldd:setup
/ldd:next
/ldd:scope
/ldd:elaborate
/ldd:refine
/ldd:design
/ldd:plan
/ldd:decompose
/ldd:implement
```

## Install

### Codex

Use `$skill-installer` from inside Codex and ask it to install the skills listed by `agent-skills.json`:

```text
Use $skill-installer to install all skills from
https://github.com/awjreynolds/ledger-driven-development
using agent-skills.json.
```

Until the stock installer reads `agent-skills.json` directly, install the paths in that manifest:

```text
skills/ldd-setup
skills/ldd-next
skills/ldd-scope
skills/ldd-elaborate
skills/ldd-refine
skills/ldd-design
skills/ldd-plan
skills/ldd-decompose
skills/ldd-implement
```

Installed Codex skills are local copies under `~/.codex/skills`. They are not live-linked to this repository. To update, remove the installed `ldd-*` skills, reinstall from the current `agent-skills.json`, and restart Codex.

### Claude Code

Add this repository as a plugin marketplace, then install the plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add awjreynolds/ledger-driven-development
/plugin install ldd@ledger-driven-development
```

Restart Claude Code after installing.

### Gemini CLI

Install this repository as a Gemini CLI extension:

```sh
gemini extensions install https://github.com/awjreynolds/ledger-driven-development
```

Restart Gemini CLI after installing. The extension provides `commands/ldd/*.toml`, which map to `/ldd:setup`, `/ldd:next`, `/ldd:scope`, `/ldd:elaborate`, `/ldd:refine`, `/ldd:design`, `/ldd:plan`, `/ldd:decompose`, and `/ldd:implement`.

## Source Of Truth

- Workflow state: repo-local `ledger.yml` files in the target project.
- Skill package: `agent-skills.json`.
- Command behavior: `skills/ldd-*/SKILL.md`.
- Claude adapters: `commands/ldd/*.md`.
- Gemini adapters: `commands/ldd/*.toml` plus `GEMINI.md`.

External trackers are optional review and sync surfaces. They are not canonical LDD state.

## MVP Workflow

```text
draft PRD ledger
  -> promoted Product Requirement ticket
  -> SDD/Plan
  -> child vertical-slice tickets
  -> implementation
  -> completed children archived
```

The repo-local `ledger.yml` is canonical. External trackers are synchronized only when configured and approved by the human.

## Handoff Artifacts

`/ldd:setup` installs templates into a target repository:

```text
.ldd/config.yml
.ldd/templates/ledger.yml
.ldd/templates/prd.md
.ldd/templates/sdd.md
.ldd/templates/plan.md
.ldd/templates/plan.html
.ldd/templates/pr-body-prd.md
.ldd/templates/pr-body-sdd-plan.md
.ldd/templates/pr-body-implementation.md
docs/tickets/_drafts/
docs/tickets/_archive/
```

The templates are quality contracts, not blank forms:

- PRDs keep product scope separate from technical design.
- SDDs translate approved PRDs into designs grounded in code and ADRs.
- Plans trace acceptance criteria to implementation slices and verification.
- Decomposition turns approved plan slices into child vertical-slice tickets.
- PR bodies focus reviewers on the correct handoff question.
