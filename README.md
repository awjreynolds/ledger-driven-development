# GADD [![Install via skills.sh](https://img.shields.io/badge/skills.sh-install-green)](https://skills.sh/awjreynolds/gadd)

GADD is a software-delivery methodology built on [Governed Autonomy](docs/governed-autonomy/README.md): the business-process discipline of delegating work to autonomous systems while keeping accountability, authority, scope, evidence, escalation, approval, and closure boundaries explicit.

GADD manages Work Items across triage, product scope, engineering design, planning, implementation, verification, and closure. External issues are collaboration surfaces; repo-local ledgers remain canonical workflow state.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add awjreynolds/gadd
```

List the available skills without installing:

```bash
npx skills add awjreynolds/gadd --list
```

Install every GADD skill non-interactively:

```bash
npx skills add awjreynolds/gadd --all -y
```

## Available Skills

- `/gadd:setup` - Bootstrap GADD config, templates, Work Item directories, and optional external projection settings.
- `/gadd:next` - Read repo-local ledger state and report the next command or human action.
- `/gadd:triage` - Normalize unclassified intake, including free-form prompts, into a Work Item and route it to implementation, SDD, PRD discovery, or a terminal state.
- `/gadd:research` - Gather sanitized product and repo evidence before scoping.
- `/gadd:scope` - Define Product Requirement scope boundaries.
- `/gadd:elaborate` - Fill product detail inside approved scope.
- `/gadd:refine` - Prepare the PRD for engineering handoff and approval.
- `/gadd:approve` - Approve exactly one PRD, SDD, or plan gate.
- `/gadd:design` - Create or update the repo-scoped SDD.
- `/gadd:plan` - Create the implementation plan and review copy.
- `/gadd:decompose` - Turn an approved plan into reviewable Work Item slices.
- `/gadd:implement` - Implement one ready Work Item, or all ready Work Items, with code and tests.
- `/gadd:verify` - Verify implemented child work before closure.
- `/gadd:close` - Apply human-approved workflow closure.
- `/gadd:archive` - Optionally archive already-closed local Work Item packages.
- `/gaps:author` - Author or revise a GAPS process specification from an existing governed process.
- `/gaps:validate` - Validate GAPS process specifications and implementation maps.

## Entry Paths

- Known product discovery starts with `/gadd:research` or `/gadd:scope`.
- Unclassified intake starts with `/gadd:triage`, including free-form prompts such as `/gadd:triage create a new release of this package`.
- Existing Work Items continue with `/gadd:next`.

## Workflow

![GADD workflow across requirements analysis, design, development, and verification](docs/assets/gadd-sdlc-workflow.png)

GADD governs the SDLC slice from Requirements Analysis through Testing / Verification. It does not claim to own enterprise planning, deployment operations, or long-term maintenance; it keeps AI-assisted delivery inside clear handoffs from approved requirements to verified implementation.

## Templates

The setup templates are bundled with the `gadd-setup` skill under `skills/gadd-setup/assets/templates/`. When `/gadd:setup` runs in a target repository, it copies those templates into that repository's `gadd/templates/` directory.

## More Detail

- [docs/governed-autonomy/](docs/governed-autonomy/README.md) explains the broader Governed Autonomy philosophy, operating model, uncontrolled AI risk patterns, and the GADD case study.
- [gaps/](gaps/README.md) incubates GAPS, the Governed Autonomy Process Specification layer, with GADD implemented as the first GAPS-described skill package.
- [docs/workflow.md](docs/workflow.md) covers workflow state, external projections, the MVP workflow, and handoff artifact contracts.
- [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md) catalogs the `/gadd:*` skills by lane, purpose, input, output, and usual handoff.
- [docs/package-model.md](docs/package-model.md) covers package layout and compatibility surfaces.
