## Problem

LDD now has a clear SDLC flow, rich external tickets, and standalone command-shaped skills, but downstream agents still lack a compact phase header that tells them what is approved, what context is authoritative, and what gate must be satisfied next.

Implementation closure is also underspecified. `/ldd:implement` can produce code and tests, but LDD does not yet have a separate closure gate that decides whether a child ticket is verified, ready to archive, and safe to close externally.

## Goals

- Define a compact LDD execution context/header that summarizes approved artifacts, phase state, boundaries, and the next gate for a ticket.
- Add an explicit verification gate after implementation and before archive/external close.
- Preserve LDD's existing separation between product scope, software design, planning, decomposition, implementation, and closure.
- Keep the feature agent-agnostic and standalone; it must not depend on external skills or a specific host agent.
- Make the workflow easier to resume, audit, and hand off across agents without requiring every phase to reread every artifact from scratch.

## Non-goals

- Do not build a general repository healthcheck.
- Do not add a full external tracker sync engine.
- Do not add multi-agent orchestration or swarm execution.
- Do not replace PRD, SDD, or plan artifacts with a single large state file.
- Do not make the SDD responsible for cross-phase workflow state.
- Do not introduce global ledger state outside per-ticket LDD artifacts.

## Users / Personas

- Product reviewer - needs confidence that product scope remains separate from design and implementation.
- Engineering reviewer - needs to see whether implementation matches the approved design and plan.
- Implementation agent - needs a compact handoff that identifies the approved context and the next gate.
- Maintainer - needs to resume LDD work without guessing which phase owns the next action.

## User Stories

1. As an implementation agent, I want a compact LDD context/header for the active ticket, so that I know which artifacts are approved, which boundaries apply, and what gate must be satisfied next.
2. As an engineering reviewer, I want implementation work to pass a dedicated LDD verification gate before closure, so that code is not treated as done until evidence is checked against the child ticket, PRD, SDD, and plan.
3. As a maintainer resuming work, I want workflow state and next action to be visible without reconstructing the whole history from conversation, so that I can continue the correct LDD phase safely.
4. As a product reviewer, I want verification to preserve product scope boundaries, so that implementation does not silently add scope or bypass the approved Product Requirement.
5. As an external tracker user, I want closure state to remain consistent with the repo-local ledger, so that external tickets do not appear complete before LDD verification has passed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Draft: A ticket exposes enough compact context for an agent or maintainer to understand the current phase, approved inputs, boundaries, and next required gate.
- Draft: Implementation completion and ticket closure are treated as separate workflow states.
- Draft: A verification gate can produce a clear recommendation about whether child work is ready to mark done, archive, and close externally.
- Draft: Closure is blocked when required evidence is missing, checks fail, scope/design drift is detected, or external ticket drift is unresolved.
- Draft: When implementation evidence exists but closure has not been approved, LDD can indicate that verification is the next required gate.
- Draft: The workflow remains local-ledger-first and does not require external skills, agent-specific orchestration, or a broad repository healthcheck.

## Success Metrics

- A maintainer can identify the active ticket's current phase and next gate from LDD artifacts without relying on chat history.
- A child ticket cannot be archived or externally closed in the documented workflow until verification has passed or a human explicitly overrides the finding.
- Generated verification output is understandable to product and engineering reviewers without reading every source artifact end to end.
- Hostile tests cover attempted gate bypasses, including implementing without verification and closing with missing evidence.

## Dependencies

- LDD must remain repo-local-ledger-first.
- LDD skills must remain standalone and agent-agnostic.
- The context/header must be usable before, during, and after SDD creation, so it cannot be owned only by the SDD.
- Verification must be specific to child-ticket closure, not broad repository health.

## Open Questions

- Should the execution context be a separate per-ticket file or a section inside the existing ledger? Owner: engineering design.
- What minimum evidence is required before `/ldd:verify` can recommend closure? Owner: refinement.
- Does verification close only child tickets in MVP, or can it also verify a parent Product Requirement once all children are done? Owner: refinement.
