# Verification Report: LDD-0001-004

Verification status: passed

## Summary

- Parent: LDD-0001
- Child: LDD-0001-004 - Define /ldd:verify workflow and report contract
- Closure recommendation: verified and ready for `/ldd:close LDD-0001-004`
- Timestamp: 2026-05-14T08:42:52Z
- Verifier: agent

## Approved Inputs

- PRD: `docs/tickets/LDD-0001-verify-context-header/prd.md` approved
- SDD: `docs/tickets/LDD-0001-verify-context-header/sdd.md` approved
- Plan: `docs/tickets/LDD-0001-verify-context-header/plan.md` approved
- Child ticket: `docs/tickets/LDD-0001-verify-context-header/children/LDD-0001-004-verify-workflow-contract/ticket.md`

## Execution Context

Boundary: child-ticket closure only, not repository health.

## Implementation Evidence

- Child ledger records implementation completion at `2026-05-13T11:05:28Z`.
- Expanded `skills/ldd-verify/SKILL.md` with standalone child-ticket closure verification workflow.
- Defined `passed`, `failed`, and `override_required` verification outcomes and closure-state updates.
- Updated source and copied `verification.md` templates with evidence, drift, finding, and human-confirmation fields.
- Extended validation checks for verify report and closure contract wording.

## Acceptance-Criteria Traceability

- `/ldd:verify` is scoped to child-ticket closure, not repository health.
- The command reads child and parent ledgers, approved artifacts, child ticket, evidence, checks, and external drift metadata.
- The command writes `verification.md` and updates child ledger verification status.
- The command blocks closure for missing evidence, failed checks, drift, or unresolved external tracker changes.
- External tracker mutation remains forbidden without human confirmation.

## Check Evidence

- `bash scripts/validate-ldd-mvp.sh`: passed
- `git diff --check`: passed
- Relevant command/template files present: `skills/ldd-verify/SKILL.md`, source `verification.md` template, copied `.ldd/templates/verification.md`

## Drift Review

- Ledger drift: none detected.
- Approved artifact drift: none detected.
- Scope/design/plan drift: none detected.
- External tracker drift: not applicable; tracker mode is local.

## Findings

- Blockers: none.
- Warnings: none.
- Notes: this verifies the verification contract itself, including blocking behavior and external mutation boundaries.

## Closure Decision

- Local done: yes
- Local archive readiness: yes
- External close readiness: not applicable in local tracker mode
- Human confirmation required before external mutation: yes
