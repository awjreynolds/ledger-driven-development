# Verification Report: LDD-0001-002

Verification status: passed

## Summary

- Parent: LDD-0001
- Child: LDD-0001-002 - Add ledger execution context and verification templates
- Closure recommendation: verified and ready for `/ldd:close LDD-0001-002`
- Timestamp: 2026-05-14T08:42:52Z
- Verifier: agent

## Approved Inputs

- PRD: `docs/tickets/LDD-0001-verify-context-header/prd.md` approved
- SDD: `docs/tickets/LDD-0001-verify-context-header/sdd.md` approved
- Plan: `docs/tickets/LDD-0001-verify-context-header/plan.md` approved
- Child ticket: `docs/tickets/LDD-0001-verify-context-header/children/LDD-0001-002-ledger-context-templates/ticket.md`

## Execution Context

Boundary: child-ticket closure only, not repository health.

## Implementation Evidence

- Child ledger records implementation completion at `2026-05-13T11:00:35Z`.
- Added `execution_context`, verification artifact state, and closure state to source and copied ledger templates.
- Added source and copied `verification.md` templates.
- Updated `/ldd:setup` installed artifact list to include `verification.md`.
- Added glossary and relationship language for Execution Context, Verification, Closure, and Verified Child Work.

## Acceptance-Criteria Traceability

- Ledger templates include `execution_context` fields for phase, gate, next action, reason, approved artifacts, and boundaries.
- Child ledger shape includes verification artifact and closure state.
- `verification.md` exists in source setup templates and copied `.ldd/templates`.
- Setup documentation includes verification as an installed handoff artifact.
- Glossary/docs define execution context, verification, and closure without adding global ledger state or `progress.md`.

## Check Evidence

- `bash scripts/validate-ldd-mvp.sh`: passed
- `git diff --check`: passed
- Template files present: `.ldd/templates/ledger.yml`, `.ldd/templates/verification.md`, `skills/ldd-setup/assets/templates/ledger.yml`, `skills/ldd-setup/assets/templates/verification.md`

## Drift Review

- Ledger drift: none detected.
- Approved artifact drift: none detected.
- Scope/design/plan drift: none detected.
- External tracker drift: not applicable; tracker mode is local.

## Findings

- Blockers: none.
- Warnings: none.
- Notes: verification recommends local closure only; external mutation would still require explicit human confirmation.

## Closure Decision

- Local done: yes
- Local archive readiness: yes
- External close readiness: not applicable in local tracker mode
- Human confirmation required before external mutation: yes
