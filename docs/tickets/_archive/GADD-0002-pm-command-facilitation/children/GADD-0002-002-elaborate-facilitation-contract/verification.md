## Summary

- Parent Product Requirement: GADD-0002
- Child Work Item: GADD-0002-002
- Verification status: passed
- Closure recommendation: ready_for_human_approved_close
- Verified at: 2026-05-13T11:33:00Z
- Verified by: agent

## Approved Inputs

- Product Requirement: docs/tickets/GADD-0002-pm-command-facilitation/prd.md (approved)
- Software Design: docs/tickets/GADD-0002-pm-command-facilitation/sdd.md (approved)
- Implementation Plan: docs/tickets/GADD-0002-pm-command-facilitation/plan.md (approved)

## Execution Context

- Current gate: verification
- Boundary: child-ticket closure only, not repository health
- Next command: /gadd:close GADD-0002-002
- Next human action: approve local closure/archive if desired
- Reason: Verification passed and external tracker mode is local.

## Implementation Evidence

- Changed files: skills/gadd-elaborate/SKILL.md
- Implementation notes: Added Facilitation Protocol, Product Quality Bar, and Exit Gate sections with product-detail questions and scope-protection behavior.
- Traceability to acceptance criteria: complete
- Evidence complete: yes

## Check Evidence

- Automated checks:
  - `git diff --check -- skills/gadd-scope/SKILL.md skills/gadd-elaborate/SKILL.md skills/gadd-refine/SKILL.md docs/tickets/GADD-0002-pm-command-facilitation`
  - `./scripts/validate-gadd-mvp.sh`
  - targeted `rg` for `Facilitation Protocol`, `Guided`, `Context dump`, `Best guess`, `Product Quality Bar`, and `Exit Gate`
- Manual checks: verified elaborate command preserves scoped goals/non-goals and keeps criteria product-facing.
- Failed or skipped checks: none
- Check evidence complete: yes
